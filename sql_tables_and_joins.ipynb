    "**A Primary Key** is the **unique identifier** for a record in a table. You cannot have a Null value in the primary key column, nor can any two records share the same value in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Foreign Key** is a field in a table that serves as the primary key for another table. Although this field must contain unique values in the table for which it serves as a primary key, it **does NOT have to contain unique values** in the table for which it serves as a foreign key.\n",

Each customer has a unique code in the CUSTOMERS table but that code can be used multiple times (MANY) in the ORDERS table with the uniqe id OrderNo, the primary key in the ORDERS table. The foreign key field in the ORDERS table, CustomerNo, can appear multiple times because a single customer from the CUSTOMERS table can have multiple orders, each with a unique OrderNo. \n",
